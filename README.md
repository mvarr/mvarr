# About Me

Computer Engineering student navigating the world of software development and cybersecurity. Strong focus on system architecture, algorithm efficiency, and functional programming. I write clean, practical code that worksâ€”simple as that.

## Tech Stack & Interests

- **Languages:** C, Go, Python
- **Paradigms:** Functional Programming, Low-Level Systems
- **OS:** Fedora (Primary), Windows (Backup)
- **Tools:** Git, Vim, Obsidian, Docker
- **Security:** Network Analysis, Ethical Hacking, Network Management
- **Software Development:** Performance Optimization, Architectural Design
- **AI & ML:** Prompt Engineering, LLM Model Fine-Tuning
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Kubernetes, CI/CD Basics
- **Embedded Systems:** Arduino

## Current Work

- **Spellchecker in Go** (still evolving) ([mvarr/GoTypo](https://github.com/mvarr/GoTypo))
- **Software Engineering Project:** 2D CFD Simulator with Navier-Strokes equations (Work in Progress)
- **Automata Theory & Computation:** Diving into DFA, NFA, and Turing Machines
- **Programming Languages:** Programming Paradigms, Syntax & Semantics, Functional Programming (Haskell Basics)
- **Cybersecurity Training:** Learning, testing, breaking, fixing. CTF Beginner.

## Open Source & Side Projects

- **GoTypo** ([mvarr/GoTypo](https://github.com/mvarr/GoTypo))
- **xoxgo** ([mvarr/xoxgo](https://github.com/mvarr/xoxgo))
- **itunes_duplicate_detector** ([mvarr/itunes_duplicate_detecter](https://github.com/mvarr/itunes_duplicate_detecter))
- **Personal Site:** [mvarr.github.io](https://github.com/mvarr/mvarr.github.io)

Looking to contribute to open-source projects. If you have recommendations, let me know.

## Workflow & Principles

- **Productivity:** Efficiency without chaos
- **Version Control:** Clear commits, no "final_final_v2" nonsense
- **Code Quality:** Readable, scalable, maintainable
- **Learning Approach:** Theory is fine, but execution is what matters
- **Software Development:** Make it work first, make it elegant second
